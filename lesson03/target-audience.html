                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience for this site is the business owners in the area
                    who are looking to start a business, or to help their current business. There is also the members of the city who we are
                    trying to target to be apart of the chamber, who will help raise money, put on fundraisers,
                    and have good connections within the town. Specifically for Montana, the target audience is for the bankers,
                    farmers, and the mining industry. These businesses do very well, and they want to know what is going on in the city 
                    to better profit their businesses, and the local people in the city as well.

                <h2>Persona 1</h2>
                <p>Gary Larson is a 50 year old farmer who just inhereted land from his inlaws who just passed away, and he has big dreams of turning it into
                    an alfalfa field. He makes around $90,000 a year as a cattle rancher in Wyoming. He has big goals to develop the land to also benefit his livestock,
                    and strike some deals with the local livestock owners aswell. He was a rancher growing up, and only has a highschool diploma, but his father taught 
                    him all there is to know about making a living off of the land. He is an empty nester with just his wife who loves the scenery of her old hometown, 
                    and they want to move into the small house on the land. They recently heard about the Montana Chamber of Commerce, and they know the connections they 
                    hold with their chamber back in Wyoming helped them a lot when they first started out, and so they are looking for answers on the desktops
                    at the local library.
                </p>
                <h2>Persona 2</h2>
                <p>Chris Lennard is a 25 year old recent graduate of MSU who just got a job as a member of the city
                    planners in the area. He does not have much experience in the feild, but he wants to make a difference,
                    and help the city grow and flourish to it's potential. He could make up to $60,000 this year if he stays 
                    with this company. He is single, and does not have any connection to his family back home in Georgia. His best friend 
                    mentioned an organization that could help him in his endevours called the Montana Chamber of Commerce,
                    and sent him a link through his phone to check them out. He is currently in the 
                    airport flying home from a vacation over the holidays as he is viewing the site from his mobile device.  
                </p>
                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gary Larson is looking on the site for a place to find 
                        the community resources. To find the answer to his problem, he could use the navigation section to 
                        find the tab called "Community" and then expand it to find the 
                        community resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gary Larson was able to find that the community has the resources and the connections
                        that he needs, and now he is looking for how he can contact someone, and even join the chanmber.
                        He looked at the top of the desktop to find the button that said "Join the Chamber" and near it there was
                        also a contact and phone number that he could call if he had any questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chris Lennard wants to find all of the social media links that this chamber has so he can do his research on
                        them and what they represent before he mentions to his new boss, and board of the benefits they would have if they were in
                        connection with the local Chamber of Commerce. He found that on his mobile device at the top corner there was a menu that dropped down
                        and included all of the social media icons, with links to each of their pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chris was able to find all that he needed about this chamber, and continued to do his research on what different types of businesses 
                        are a part of the chamber to see if he would be able to make good connections within the community, and who would be there to help him find 
                        out more about the impact they make on the businesses. He found at the bottom of the home page, there was a heading labeled "Thank you to all our supporting partners", and 
                        he was able to find all of the local businesses who are members of this chamber, and he would be able ot compile a list and reach out to them to get to 
                        know them more before joining the chamber and finding out more about the city and infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>The last thing that Chris wanted to double check was the reliability of the chamber before he called his boss and mentioned how they would benefit from being connected to the
                        chamber. To check the reliability, he wanted to find testamonials of the community, and the business owners who are supporting this cause. In the sandwiched navigation section he 
                        found a tab labeled "Membership" he found an embedded tab labeled testimonials that was easy to locate, and directed him to the exact page that included screenshots, and honest comments about the 
                        chamber and confirmed why he should join, and be involved in working with them and the other businesses.
