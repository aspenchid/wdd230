                    MD that builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near

                <section id="targetAudience">
                    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The Temple Inn & Suites specifically targets members of The Church of Jesus Christ 
                    of Latter-day Saints. These particular members are those who are visiting the temple
                    in the area, and are wanting a safe and close place to stay the night. Whether they are 
                    doing sealings, weddings, receptions, or youth trips, this is the best place for them 
                    to stay. Even if they are traveling from the airport, we provide a 24-hour shutttle service
                    from the airport, and another shuttle to the temple during the hours it is open. This is exactly 
                    what these members are here for because they are traveling to be in the temple, and they shouldn't have
                    to worry or stress about any of the other accomidaitons needed. 
                </p>

                    serve a mission. She already has her call to Chile, and she will be leaving in a few months.
                    She wants to get endowed for the first time, and she has sent out invitations to her family members
                    who live all over the country. She is a faithful member of the church, and she has loved doing
                    baptisms for the dead and serving her fellow brothers and sisters. Her parents are willing to pay for everything
                    that has to do with her mission.   
                </p>
                <h3>Persona 2</h3>
                <p>Greg and Diana Lewiston have a goal to visit every single temple in the United States while they are alive.
                    They have already been to half of them, and they love to invite their children, and grandchildren along for the ride.
                    They are retired, and have a lot of money so they love to travel and serve God. They have been members for 70+ years,
                    and have been sealed in the temple for more than half of their lives. 
                </p>
                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Lilly wants to include a website on her fliers to have all of her family members stay at the same place while travelling
                    so it makes it easier for her parents to book their stay. She found the best website link to include at: templesuitestay.com 
                </p>
                <p>Greg is looking at the website to find out how he can book a reservation. He found it easily on the Home page, and it
                    stood out so he didn't have to scroll too far. It was noticably labeled "Book Now!"
                </p>
                <p>Diana is a planner, and she is already looking at which temple they should travel to next. Unter the "Temple" tag
                    she finds a list of temples that she adds to the list. 
                </p>
                <p>Greg's son is very needy, and he needs to be sure that if he is to go on the trip with his parents that the place they stay
                    is up to date so he can bring his work, and be comfortable. He finds the "Services" page that provides a list with 
                    information of the amenities and special services offered at the hotel.
