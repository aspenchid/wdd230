                        <p>The Salt Lake Temple began construction in 1853 when the Pioneers used
                            oxen to haul mammoth blocks of granite 15 miles down a canyon and across 
                            the valley. The building site was dedicated on April 6th, 1893. 
                            The ground breaking was on February 14th, 1853, and was finally
                            announced on July 28th, 1847. The temple and grounds are currently 
                            under construction, but visitors are welcome to peruse the grounds 
                            and admire the stunning workmanship of the building and the serene 
                            beauty of its immediate surroundings.

                        <h2>Temple Activities</h2>
                        <p>The temple is a sacred place where we can draw closer to our Heavenly Father
                            and Jesus Christ. In the temple, we are taught important truths, participate
                            in priesthood ordinances (sacred ceremonies), and make covenants (sacred
                            promises) with God that prepare us to return to His presence.<br>
                            We can receive temple ordinances for ourselves as well as for our ancestors. 
                            For example, youth can participate in baptisms in behalf of their ancestors 
                            and others who didn‚Äôt have the chance to be baptized by proper authority when 
                            they were alive. For adults, other temple ordinances include the endowment and 
                            sealings (such as temple marriage).</p>
