                        This webpage shows the design element of contrast
                        with the colors they used in relation to the text and the background. The consistent black logo with 
                        the white background, and then with the dark image having white 
                        letters on the dark green grass. The button for shop now is surrounded
                        with white space, and makes the "shop now" stand out so much more
                        because it is so light compared to the dark surroundings.

                        This webpage shows visual hierarchy with the different emphasis that is put on
                        the different important pieces of text. First, the eyes are naturally drawn to 
                        the bold letters saying <strong>"New Donors Earn up to $975"</strong> which is 
                        their main message they want to get across to their audience. Then, the eye moves 
                        to the image where it repeats the amount of money you will earn if you donate.
                        The large text is what draws the attention there. Next, the last big element 
                        in the line of hierarchy is the "Sign up" button that is surrounded with white 
                        space and is dark blue contrasting with the background to stand out. These three
                        elements in order of their hierarchy show that there is more emphasis that the company wants to put on certain 
                        spots on the website.

                    <p>
                        The Subway website looks very neat and organized due to the left alignment
                        of all the similar text. The text is consistent throughout the page and 
                        a clear line can be drawn where the margin of the text is. The lines that the text make
                        keep the page organized and makes it easier for the eye to read left to right. 
                        The alignment of the "Order now" button is center-aligned with the image to be consistent
                        with what is surrounding it, and so there is more of a central focus and it draws the audience in to make an order.
                        This was stratigically placed in line with the sandwiches to correlate the sandwich to 
                        what will be ordered.
